## Overview

Samarth takes too many clicks, logs out repeatedly, and forces you to calculate attendance manually.

This tracker gives you what you need immediately:
- Overall and per-subject attendance percentages
- Exact safe bunks left before dropping below 75%
- Required classes to attend if attendance is below 75%
- Full session records with dates and timestamps
